				<h2 class="jsb">JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<span class="jsb">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
   JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
   It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
   JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
   it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</span>
   				<ul>
   					<li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a><span class="jsb">JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values -
    imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
    These uniq</span></li>
   					<li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a><span class="jsb">Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables -
    our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
    The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <mark>var x = 10;</mark>
</span></li>
   					<li><a href="#">Data Types</a><span class="jsb">Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
    There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
    Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159;
    String - <mark>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</mark> Array - [1, <mark>'Coding'</mark>, 2, 'Dojo'];
    and Object - <mark>{first_name: 'Jane', last</mark></span></li>
   					<li><a href="#">Conditionals</a><span class="jsb">When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions
    - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.
    You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
    There are the following conditional statements;
    <mark>if</mark> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
    <mark>else if</mark> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
    <mark>else</mark> we execute this block of code.</span></li>
   					<li><a href="#">Loops</a><span class="jsb">There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
    but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times.
    Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
    That's a loop!
</span></li>
   					<li><a href="#">Function</a><span class="jsb">Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.
    When we call our function this will run that code block.
    Think of it as a list of instructions.
    As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea,
    we open up the instruction manual and get started,
    first we screw the legs to the table top;
    next we place the table the right way up. Done!
    We finished our instructions.
    Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.
